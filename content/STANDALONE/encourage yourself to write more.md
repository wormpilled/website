# Tips and Tricks to Do it

# Social Pressure

## Discord Chat

- log the word count changes each daily in segments, every 6 hours perhaps
- how much was removed, how much was added
- new notes created
- additions to already drafted notes?
	- post these details to a discord chat in a meta way, so your peers can see and encourage you
	- so you can feel 'guilty' about not working much
	- or just be reminded about your goals to write and why its important

## Lowering the Friction to Write

- it should be really simply to write
- you should make systems to make it as easy as possible to contribute a new blurb or thought to something
- [ ] dmenu script ot quickly jot something down in a blog post based on title, use dmenu itself to insert the 'quick note' (first interaction)
- [ ] then choose the proper file for it, or you might want to make a new one
- [ ] THEN open it in obsidian (capturing the idea spark from keyboard shortkey - writing most important)

# Systems to Remind Yourself of Your Goals

- [x] gamification
- [ ] streaks
- [ ] inspiration/motiviation reminders
- [ ] punishments for not following through
